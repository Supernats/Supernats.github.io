      I attack every situation I face with the same mentality; if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right. It's all well and good to make something that "works," but I need to get into it and exploit all the "hows" of that functionality.
    </p>

    <p class="personal-text">
      Object orientation is my heart and method decomposition is the blood it pumps. In the battle of concision vs expression, I will always come to bat for expression. Top level execution should always be as abstracted as possible; if something can be represented as one atomic piece of functionality, it must.

      If this sounds like the kind of thing you're interested in, I'd love to talk. Thanks for stopping by.
