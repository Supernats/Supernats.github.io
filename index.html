    Ahoy, I'm Nathan.
  </p>
  
  <p class="personal-text">
    I'm a web developer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I build apps in Ruby on Rails and Javascript, with a strong love of Backbone.
  </p>

  <p class="personal-text">
    I attack every situation I face with the same mentality; if it's worth doing, it's worth doing right. It's all well and good to make something that "works," but I need to get into it and exploit all the "hows" of that functionality. I believe in creating a user experience that answers their questions before they know about them. I believe in simplicity as a guiding principle of design.
  </p>

  <p class="personal-text">
    Object orientation is my heart and method decomposition is the blood it pumps. Even if you only call something once, I'd rather break it out and give it its own space to breathe. In the battle of concision vs expression, I will always come to bat for expression. Keystrokes and bytes are far cheaper than time wasted sorted through someone else's "clever" code. Top level execution should always be as abstracted as possible.
